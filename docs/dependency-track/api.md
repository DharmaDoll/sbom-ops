# Dependency-Track API Usage

Official API documentation is the source of truth.

Before changing API code, check:

- endpoint path
- HTTP method
- required permission
- request format
- response format
- pagination behavior
- async processing behavior
- error response behavior

## Used API Areas

The orchestrator is expected to use API areas related to:

- Projects
- BOM upload
- Findings
- Vulnerabilities
- Analysis
- VEX
- EPSS and finding risk metadata
- Teams/API keys

## Implementation Rule

All Dependency-Track API calls must be implemented in:

`src/sbom_ops/clients/dependency_track.py`

The client must expose intent-based methods, not raw endpoint names.

Dependency-Track is the preferred source for EPSS values and VEX-derived
analysis state. The client should expose normalized finding fields for these
values. VEX upload and analysis-state mutation require explicit workflow
support and permissions; they are not part of the MVP.

The MVP read path uses the following intent-level operations:

- `GET /api/v1/project` to enumerate accessible projects
- `GET /api/v1/project/{uuid}` to resolve project metadata
- `GET /api/v1/finding/project/{uuid}` to retrieve findings and analysis state
- `GET /api/v1/vulnerability/project/{uuid}` as the EPSS fallback source when a
  finding response does not include an EPSS value

The findings API requires the `VIEW_VULNERABILITY` permission. Endpoint details
must be validated against the target instance's OpenAPI document before
production deployment.

Good:

```python
list_projects()
get_project_findings(project_uuid)
upload_bom(project_uuid, bom_path)
update_analysis_state(...)
```

Bad:

```python
get_api_v1_finding_project_uuid(...)
post_api_v1_bom(...)
```
